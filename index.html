<p>The understanding of wildlife in the world of today is faily lacking amongst our youth.</p>
<p>This website was created, in essense, to combat that fact. It may sound simple or 
    insignificant but just understanding a little bit can save our planet.</p>

<head><h2>Birds</h2></head>
<body style="background-color: #77DD77;">
<p>As members of ecosystems, birds play many roles, including as predators, pollinators, 
scavengers, seed dispersers, seed predators, and ecosystem engineers.
</p>
<p>
Out of this entire rock called Earth, my personal favourite animal would be a bird.
</p>
<p>
Birds can be almost any color from red, blue, green to gold. 
I like to think they are the artists of natural world.
They are very diverse amongst themselves, 
by that i mean they have different roles which means they can do different 
things with regards to hunting, scavanging and foraging.
</p>
<p>
To give a few examples:
An Owl is a majestic hunter. It is also understood to be one of the most successful hunters on the planet.
Due to the design of their feathers, being sort of fluffy towards the end, they fly like deadly assassins,
silently and grcacefully, seemingly without effort.</p>

Another one would be a Peregrine falcon. This fairly small bird is the fastest animal on the planet.
They can fly up to speeds of 300 km/h. The Bugatti of the animal kingdom.
They hunt smaller birds that most people would consider pests of the city like red eyed doves.</p>

Last but absolutely not least, Vultures.
They are the clean-up crew of nature. Without Vultures our Safaries and wentlands would be a breeding ground for diseases.
Vultures eat the carcuses of dead animals, big and small. You might think how they might be able to digest this kind of feast
without dying to disease, well, they have stomach acid that enables them to digest these foods without 
issue. In turn they fertilize the soilof the land with their excrement providing nutrition for new plants
and vegetation.</p>
